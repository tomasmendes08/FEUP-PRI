          "Bedtime Stories is clean enough to fly the Walt Disney Pictures flag, yet it's full of bimbos and cleavage and shots of Adam Sandler getting kicked in the shins by a dwarf.",
          "The shortage of wit and the excess of goo can be summed up in Sandler's line to these children of divorce: 'I'm like the stink on your feet -- I'll always be there.'",
          "Box-office commodity Adam Sandler is repositioned as kid-friendly in Bedtime Stories, a Disney movie that plays better on a balance sheet than a screen.",
          "Bedtime Stories is not my cup of tea. Even the saucer. Fairness requires me to report, however, that it may appeal to, as they say, 'kids of all ages.'",
          "The new Disney movie Bedtime Stories presents a taste test for moviegoers: Do you prefer your Adam Sandler regular strength or in the new mild format?",
          "Adam Shankman's idea of directing a Walt Disney film is to pump toxic quantities of schmaltz into every available hole. Not a pleasant sight.",
          "Judged as a piece of family entertainment, it's too haphazard and poorly paced to satisfy viewers too young to have ever attended a kegger.",
          "In Bedtime Stories the pain of this artistic limbo is written all over Adam Sandler's character, a resentful hotel handyman named Skeeter.",
          "When it comes to holiday tales, it would be best to reread The Night Before Christmas rather than waste time or money on Bedtime Stories.",
          "It's a pleasing concept, and Sandler is at his least obnoxious, but surely Adam Shankman's family comedy could have been wittier.",
          "It descends into pathos, undermined by an insipid romantic subplot and the usual platitudinous guff about self-belief.",
          "It's a delightfully innocent movie that the actor can actually show to his two baby daughters without blushing.",
          "There's a surface liveliness to the movie, but it has that plasticky Disney quality and lack of real heart.",
          "Bedtime Stories is baloney on Wonder Bread with a Kraft Single and some Miracle Whip -- barely lunchable.",
          "All director Adam Shankman can think of to do is encourage Adam Sandler to mug like a chimpanzee",
          "Sloppy, choppy, and saved by an affably low-key and typically sophomoric Sandler performance.",
          "For a creative premise, it's downright dispiriting to see such a banal interpretation.",
          "Bedtime Stories champions imagination while having too little originality itself.",
          "Those other Adam Sandler comedies? Turns out they were the grown-up efforts."],
