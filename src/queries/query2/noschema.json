          "There's little in the way of tension, surprise or consistency, and the disappointing ending leaves questions about the point of the whole exercise.",
          "The Trust is a heist movie that gives Nicolas Cage his juiciest performance since Kick-Ass and indulges some very kooky Cageian line readings.",
