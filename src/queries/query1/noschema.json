          "With seemingly a lot of world-building to inform proceedings, but much of it unseen, the filmmakers keep a firm hand on the wheel, with Prospect remaining engrossing until the last.",
          "It's a movie that, if nothing else, should act as a calling card for the talents of these filmmakers, who manage to do a lot with a little and make a little seem like a lot.",
          "In Prospect, the mundane becomes memorable. History repeats itself in theme, but this sci-fi sandbox is a whole new world. Imaginative, robust, and impressively fine-tuned.",
          "[The filmmakers] don't invent a wondrous and awe-inspiring world of the future in Prospect. They do something much more difficult: They create a world that seems real.",

          "It's a minimalist science fiction film that builds an impressive atmosphere, but that can't escape from superficiality. [Full review in Spanish]",
          "Prospect deserves credit for its ambitious vision and scope, but Earl and Caldwell's effort is undone by mediocre script and character work.",
          "Like the pages of Heavy Metal Magazine (aka Metal Hurlant) come to life. Cast excellent. Thatcher and Pascal have True Grit chemistry.",

          "'Prospect' is a visually stunning film and may be one of the best lower budget sci-fi films we've seen in years.",
          "Prospect also moves in bends and inflections that are largely - and pleasantly - unpredictable.",
